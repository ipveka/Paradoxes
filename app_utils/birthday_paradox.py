    ### Why is this a paradox?
    Our intuition underestimates how quickly the probability grows. With just 23 people, there's over a 50% chance of a shared birthday, due to the rapid growth in the number of possible pairs. This paradox demonstrates the counterintuitive nature of combinatorics and probability in everyday situations.
    
    **Key insight:** Probability grows with the number of pairs, not just the number of people. The paradox is a great illustration of how human intuition often fails with large numbers and combinations.
