    ## Simpson's Paradox
    A trend appears in different groups of data but reverses when the groups are combined.  
    This paradox shows how misleading aggregated data can be.

    ### Why is this a paradox?
    Simpson's Paradox warns us to always check for hidden variables before drawing conclusions from data. The aggregated data can tell a very different story from the subgroup data.
    
    **Key insight:** Always look for confounding variables and analyze data at multiple levels.
